# Famo OS Open Source Playbook

## Philosophy

- **Transparency first.** All companion behaviors, prompts, and data integrations should be inspectable and modifiable.
- **Composable layers.** Treat every featureâ€”3D models, personas, data feeds, ML modulesâ€”as optional, swappable building blocks.
- **Community > ego.** Forks are celebrated. Share your forks, companion lore, or ML experiments and weâ€™ll highlight them in the showcase.
- **Security awareness.** When integrating on-chain actions (launching a token, moving liquidity) always require explicit user approval.
- **Responsible AI.** Personal data, wallets, and market signals should be handled under the most restrictive privacy assumptions.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repo** and branch off `master`.
2. **Create focused PRs.** Limit each PR to a set of related changes; include screenshots or screen recordings for UI work.
3. **Follow the style guide:**
   - TypeScript with strict linting (`npm run lint`).
   - Use React hooks and typed props.
   - Keep persona changes inside `config/persona.xml`.
4. **Document your additions** in `docs/` or inline comments if the behavior is non-obvious.
5. **Run the test and lint suites** before opening a PR.

## Seeking Maintainers & Collaborators

- **Persona designers** â€“ craft unique companion personalities and lore.
- **WebGL enthusiasts** â€“ expand the 3D model library and animation system.
- **Data scientists / ML builders** â€“ plug in bundle detectors, on-chain analytics, and predictive models.
- **Security reviewers** â€“ help design safe agentic flows for swaps, liquidity management, and token launches.

Interested? Open an issue tagged `maintainer-applicant` with your background and how youâ€™d like to help.

## Reporting Issues

1. Check existing issues and discussions.
2. Use the templates for bugs, feature requests, or security disclosures.
3. Include reproduction steps, environment details, and relevant logs.

For security-sensitive findings, email the maintainer privately or use GitHub security advisories.

## Community Etiquette

- Be respectful. Many contributors are pseudonymous buildersâ€”judge ideas, not people.
- Give credit. If you build atop an experiment from another fork, acknowledge their work.
- Share knowledge. Post ML experiments, telemetry dashboards, or deployment recipes to inspire others.

## Licensing & Attribution

Famo OS ships under the MIT License. Youâ€™re free to modify and redistribute as long as the license text remains in derivative projects.

If you ship a public fork, we appreciate a link back to the original repo and a note in your README.

## Roadmap Collaboration

We maintain the roadmap in the main README. If youâ€™d like to champion a milestone:

1. Open an issue titled `Roadmap: <feature>`.
2. Outline scope, dependencies, and intended usage.
3. Coordinate in the issue thread or project board to avoid duplication.

Letâ€™s keep Famo OS evolving as the best open agentic launchpad on the net. ðŸš€
